## [Unreleased] — 2026-03-08 (`170d4be`)

### Fixed
- **GIS "Params are not set" error** — The Google Identity Services token client is now re-created immediately before each `requestAccessToken` call, preventing stale params from a previously initialised client instance from causing the sign-in popup to fail.
- **Rubber-band selection instantly unselecting** — A `click` event fires on the canvas immediately after `mouseup`, causing `handleCanvasClick` to wipe the freshly-built selection. A ref guard now suppresses that click when it follows the end of a rubber-band drag.
- **Fence drag displacing non-member icons** — Dragging a fence over icons that are not its members now pushes those icons to the nearest free grid slot outside all fences, instead of leaving them overlapping. If no displacement is needed the move is unchanged.
- **Viewport resize leaving unfenced icons off-screen** — The resize handler previously repositioned fences only. It now also clamps any unfenced desktop icons that fall outside the visible area back within the viewport, snapped to the nearest grid cell.
- **No outer scrollbars** — `html`, `body`, and `#root` are now explicitly `overflow: hidden` via a style block in `index.html`, ensuring the app never produces a page-level scrollbar regardless of icon or fence positions.

### Added
- **Create fence from selection** — When multiple files are selected, right-clicking now shows "Create fence from N files". A new fence is created whose bounds exactly wrap the selected files, and those files become its members immediately.
- **Move files into new folder** — When multiple files are selected, right-clicking shows "Move N files into new folder…". A new Drive folder is created at the desktop root, the selected files are moved into it, and a rename dialog opens so you can name the folder straight away.
- **Fence vertical scroll** — When a fence is resized so that its visible area is smaller than the content it holds, a scrollbar indicator appears on the right edge of the fence. Scrolling the mouse wheel over the fence scrolls the icons inside it. Icons that are scrolled out of view are clipped to the fence boundary. Stored icon positions are not changed — only the visual rendering is offset.

## [Phase 3] — 2026-03-08 (`de41d5b`)

### Added
- **Folder browser modal** — Double-clicking a folder (or right-click → "Open folder") now opens a clean overlay modal showing the folder's contents as a sorted list. You can navigate into sub-folders within the same modal with a breadcrumb trail and back button. The desktop view never navigates.
- **True fence membership** — Each fence now maintains an explicit `members` list (array of file IDs). Files dragged inside a fence's boundary are added as members; files dragged out are removed. Right-clicking a fenced file shows "Remove from fence". Auto-arrange places fence members neatly within the fence and positions non-members on the open desktop.
- **Drag-to-select (rubber-band)** — Clicking and dragging on any empty area of the desktop draws a selection box. All file icons that overlap the box are selected live as you drag. Ctrl/Cmd+click still toggles individual files.
- **Sort by Name / Type / Date** — Right-click → "Sort by" section with Name, Type, Date modified, and Manual options. Choosing a named sort immediately triggers an auto-arrange in that order and persists the preference to cloud config. Manual mode preserves free-form placement.
- **Settings panel** — A ⚙️ gear button in the bottom bar (and right-click → "Settings…") opens a settings panel where you can pick any Google Drive folder as the desktop root. The desktop reloads showing just that folder's contents. A "Reset to My Drive root" button restores the default.
- **Folder child-count badges** — Folder icons now show accurate child counts from a background API fetch for folders that haven't been opened yet. Shows `?` while fetching, then switches to the real number. Previously the badge always showed `0` until the folder was opened.
- **New file format picker** — Right-click "New file" now shows three separate options: Google Doc, Google Sheet, and Google Slides — replacing the single ambiguous "New document" option.
- **Drive API** — Added `createSpreadsheet`, `createPresentation`, and `countChildren` to `src/api/drive.js`.

### Fixed
- **Snap reliability on load** — All icon positions loaded from cloud/local config are now run through `snapToGrid` during app initialisation. This prevents saved positions from being "between" grid cells after a session restore, which was causing misalignment on load.
- **Auto-arrange** — Now uses a shared `getAutoArrangePositions` function that respects fence membership and avoids placing desktop files inside fence bounds.

## [Fix: GIS auth prompt] — 2026-03-07 (`f27a668`)

### Fixed
- **"Params are not set" GIS error** — Google Identity Services throws this error when `requestAccessToken` is called with `prompt: ''` (empty string). Changed to `prompt: 'select_account'` so the account picker appears correctly and the error is avoided.

---

## [Fix: Grid snap unification] — 2026-03-07 (`efffa93`)

### Fixed
- **Drag snap and auto-arrange misalignment** — Manual drag snapping was using `0, 100, 200…` while `getInitialPositions` placed icons at `10, 110, 210…` (offset by the left/top margins). Introduced `GRID_ORIGIN_X = 10` and `GRID_ORIGIN_Y = 10` constants shared by `snapToGrid`, `getInitialPositions`, and the missing-positions `useEffect`, so all three systems always align to the same grid.

---

## [Fix: PWA icons] — 2026-03-07 (`434036a`)

### Fixed
- **Missing PWA icons (404)** — `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png` were referenced in `manifest.json` but not included in the repository. Generated programmatically with PIL (green background + orange folder shape) and committed.

---

## [Fix: Google Client ID] — 2026-03-07 (`0c6d73d`)

### Fixed
- **OAuth `invalid_client` error** — Wired in the real Google OAuth Client ID (`752970574118-rpj1tej575v110okdg61cc05phrp3h1r.apps.googleusercontent.com`) into `src/config.js`, replacing the placeholder.
- **Google Drive scopes missing** — The Google Auth Platform "Data access" section was empty; the Drive scopes (`drive`, `drive.appdata`) were added there, resolving the subsequent 403 errors on file listing.

---

## [Fix: package-lock.json] — 2026-03-07 (`91972a3`)

### Fixed
- **GitHub Actions `npm ci` failure** — The deployment workflow uses `npm ci`, which requires a `package-lock.json`. Added the lockfile to the repository.

---

## [Initial Commit] — 2026-03-07 (`da58051`)

### Added
Full initial build of the UseAble Deskmat PWA, ported from the `desktop-files-v4.jsx` single-file prototype into a structured React/Vite project.

**Architecture**
- React 18 SPA with Vite 5 build tooling
- Google Drive API v3 for all file operations (list, move, copy, rename, trash, create)
- Google Identity Services (GIS) OAuth2 implicit/token flow — no backend required
- Progressive Web App — `manifest.json`, service worker, installable on Chromebook shelf
- Drive `appDataFolder` for hidden layout config sync (positions, fences, wallpaper)
- Local-first, cloud-sync architecture: instant `localStorage` write + 2-second debounced Drive save
- GitHub Actions deployment to GitHub Pages

**Features**
- Spatial desktop: files rendered as draggable icons at freeform positions on a canvas
- Grid snap: all positions snap to a 100px grid with 10px origin margins
- Desktop Fences: draggable, resizable, roll-up grouping containers
- Multi-select with Ctrl/Cmd+click; drag multiple files together
- Drag-and-drop into folders (with drop-target highlight and tooltip)
- Folder navigation with breadcrumb bar
- Right-click and long-press context menus (rename, duplicate, move, copy, delete, link, info)
- Wallpaper selector: 8 preset gradients + custom URL/base64 upload
- Auto-arrange: reflows all visible files onto the grid
- Snap to grid: corrects any off-grid positions
- New folder and new document creation from desktop context menu
- Folder/move picker with lazy-loaded Drive folder tree
- Sync indicator in bottom bar (idle / saving / saved / error)
- Sign in with Google; sign-out; session restore from `localStorage`
- Ambient radial highlight overlay and glass-morphism UI throughout
- Touch support: long-press for context menu, drag threshold detection, vibration feedback
